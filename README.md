# GetCleanDataProject
Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

There is one script for this project:  	run_analysis.R

1. It gathers and filters the mean and standard deviation data for each observation, 
2. Assigns significant names to the activities (originally numbers from 1 to 6).
3. Merges the data of X and Y for both test and train datastets.
4. Merges the test and train datasets adding an identifier for the original dataset.
5. Melts the data to make it easily readable.
6. Generates a separate dataset with the means for each test subject and activity.
